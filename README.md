Predict survival on  titanic dataset.
1)The .ipynb file starts with data visualization
2)Process the data and perform one hot encoding if required
3) Compare model between two datasets 
    1)drop age values and then train , predict on data 
    2)predict  age values , replace them and then train , predict on data 
    Recieved Higher Accuracy and requires less components if age is precicted beforehand.
